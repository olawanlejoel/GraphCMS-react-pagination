# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and structured/developed by Joel Olawanle.

For this app, we made use of react.js to create a blog showcase application that retrieves all blogposts from GraphCMS by querying data using GraphQL and implemented pagination from scratch and using a package. Test it our [here](https://graphcms-react-pagination.netlify.app/).

## Quick Info
This repository has 4 branches of which 3 are very specific and handle pagination in different ways based on how they were explain in the GraphCMS React Pagination article.

These are the methods and they link to the specific branch so you can access their codes differently:
- [Pagination with GraphCMS and GraphQL using React and GraphCMS argument from Scratch](https://github.com/olawanlejoel/GraphCMS-react-pagination/tree/graphcms-pagination-method)
- [Pagination with React from scratch](https://github.com/olawanlejoel/GraphCMS-react-pagination/tree/js-paginate-scratch)
- [Pagination with ReactPaginate external library](https://github.com/olawanlejoel/GraphCMS-react-pagination/tree/reactpaginate-method)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
